# wow.herbie
addon for WOW classic that annotates tooltips with uses for items

Database (from wowhead) includes alchemy, leathorworking, blacksmithing,
tailoring, enchanting, and cooking.

only augments when the tooltip is created. if an existing tooltip is
reused for the material (because the previous tooltip hadn't been
dismissed), then no augmentation happens.
